# DEPRECATION NOTICE

üá∫üá∏üá¨üáß: As of Lacuna version 4.12, the built-in auto-moderation feature has been deprecated, so if you still rely on it, please consider upgrading to Discord AutoMod. As this plugin was an extension of Lacuna's built-in auto-moderation, it has now been archived. New features will no longer be added, and eventually ExAMod will be pulled out of the plugin catalogue along with Lacuna's auto-moderation. I think that in the near future there will also be a guide for an easier migration available on the [support server](https://discord.gg/lacunabot). Thank you for your understanding.

# ExAMod

_**Ex**tended **A**utomatic **Mod**eration_, few yet worthy add-ons for Lacuna auto-moderation.

**NOTE: Due to this plugin's nature, its features are only operational on servers with an active Lacuna Diamond subscription.**

## Features

1. **Mention Filtering:**

    - Prevents excessive member/role mentions, as well as everyone/here pings.

2. **Emoji Spam Filtering:**

    - Curbs the spread of excessive emojis in messages.

3. **Repeated Messages Filtering:**
    - Identifies and handles repeated messages for effective moderation.

Each module comes with configurable options. For detailed customization, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/rovius/ExAMod/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).
